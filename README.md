🚀 ATS-Compliant CV Analyzer – Powered by React, Java, Spring Boot & AI!

Job seekers often get filtered out before a human even sees their CV. I wanted to solve that. So I built a smart CV analyzer that checks your resume against Applicant Tracking Systems (ATS) standards using a combination of:

✅ React for a fast, intuitive UI
✅ Java & Spring Boot for scalable backend processing
✅ AI/NLP to extract and evaluate resume content
✅ Real-time feedback on formatting, keyword match, and structure

Whether you're applying for your first job or your tenth, this tool can help you stand out—and actually get seen.
